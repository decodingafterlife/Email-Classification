# Email-Classification
Email classification as spam or ham using various algorithms.

This is the project that I had completed as part of Natural Language Processing Certificate course conducted by the Computational Linguistic Lab and Department of Computer Engineering, Pune Institute of Computer Technology. I had made and submitted this project on Google Collab and am now uploading it on GitHub.

In this project I have used different classification techniques and have compared their accuracies.
